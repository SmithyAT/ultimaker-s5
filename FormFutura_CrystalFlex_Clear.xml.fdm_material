      Crystal Flex is a high-performance and easy to use Styrene-Butadiene Copolymer based 3D printer filament, which combines strength, resilience, semi-flexibility and transparency with printability. 
Crystal Flex filament is as clear as PolyCarbonate and has an extremely high surface gloss and by that can truly be called a bright filament. All these properties combined make Crystal Flex a diverse and wonderful filament to print with and which can be applied for a wide range of applications.

Unique features
Plexiglass-like transparency
Very clear filament with 92% light transmittance and extremely high surface gloss
Semi-flexible, bendable and resilient
Shore hardness of 63D and bendable up to 230% without causing white stress marks
Very easy to print
Practically no warping due to extremely low water-absorption properties
Improved flowing behaviour and inter-layer adhesion
Good first layer adhesion to several heated print surfaces
Engineered to meet UL 94HB flame retardancy standards
